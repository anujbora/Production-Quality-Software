/**
  * Code Review
  */

 1. Use of synchronized variable on methods :
    The implementation makes use of synchronized variable on the method itself.
    This may cause the program to work inefficiently as the program will be
    synchronizing even those parts of the data which aren't actually shared. So,
    the method-wide use of synchronization should be avoided and it should only be used
    on the data which is actually shared among multiple methods.

 2. Improper formatting :
    The code is not formatted properly. On multiple occasions(e.g. line #9, #24, etc. in
    the file StopwatchCreator.java), the number of characters on a single line exceeds the
    preferred length of 80.

 3. Incorrect use of equals()
    The equals method is basically comparing two stopwatch IDs and returning true if the
    two stopwatch IDs are same. But, the only scenario when two stopwatch IDs will be same
    is when both the stopwatches reference to same stopwatch. So basically, the equals method
    is just checking whether both the stopwatch instances are referring to same stopwatch.
    But, as mentioned in Effective Java, equals shouldn't be used to check whether the two
    objects refer to the same object; which is done here.

 4. Incorrect order of importing:
    In StopwatchFactory.java, edu.nyu.pqs.stopwatch.api.Stopwatch should have been imported
    before other java files.

 5. Didn't add @Override and {@inheritDoc}
    Multiple methods in StopwatchCreator.java override methods mentioned in the API. So,
    @Override should have been mentioned on such methods. Additionally, {@inheritDoc}
    should have been used for the overridden methods to inherit Javadocs.

6.  No messages when Exception is thrown
    In StopwatchFactory.java, getStopwatch() throws an exception when the ID is empty or
    null or if the ID already exists. But, it doesn't provides meaningful message along
    with the exception. For e.g. in case when ID already exists, instead of just throwing
    IllegalArgumentException(); IllegalArgumentException("ID already exists") could have been
    used which would have helped the client to identify the exact problem. Same holds true 
    in case of IllegalStateException();
    
7.  getLapTimes() (Line #107 - #112)
    No need to create a lap when lap times are requested when stopwatch is still running.
    
8.  SuppressWarnings
    SuppressWarnings is used but nothing is mentioned why it was used. Also, its better to
    avoid warnings than to suppress them.
