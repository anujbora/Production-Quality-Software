<h1>Assignment 4 :</h1>

For this assignment you must implement a graph data structure.  

Requirements:

Using the API it must be possible to add and remove nodes to the graph.

You must provide an iterator for traversing all of the nodes in the graph in either a depth-first or breadth-first search order.  (You can define two separate methods here rather than the simple iterator() method.)

Use the FilterIterator and Predicate code from class, but go even further and create concrete Predicate implementations that allow the user of your API to easly combine existing Predicates logically:
	AndPredicate
	OrPredicate
	NotPredicate

You must provide unit tests that fully exercise your API including your predicate implementations.
